%scale invariance through timing code (pattern completion)
%resistance to amplitude change and dropout through MANY ARE EQUAL (pattern completion)
%sequence separation/dynamic range through dendritic reader (pattern separation)
%noise correlation ~ field overlap improves separation (pattern separation, completion [speed invariance]); is this part of our criteria for a causal sequence? [relative timestamps!!!]
%show pairwise (or multiple) heat map of input/output ranges with increasing sequence differnence (pattern separation) vs increasing spacing error (pattern completion) vs increasing amplitude variability (pattern completion) 
%%are they trading off? all virtues of timing code
%this may be how we can tell what the essence of a sequence is amidst noise, may be the main job of CA3-CA1 circuit

%demonstrate robustness to weird speed variations; perhaps a cool audio example?
%throw in old sequence quality plots
%compare against firing rate over window in CA3 population; synfire chain?
